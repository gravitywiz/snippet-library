/**
 * Gravity Perks // Unique ID // Shared Sequences
 * https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-unique-id/
 *
 * Share sequences between sequential Unique ID fields; works with fields on different forms as well.
 *
 * To use the snippet, replace the numbers in the array below to match your form IDs and field IDs.
 * For example, if Form A has an ID of 123 and its Unique ID field's ID is 1 and Form B has an ID of
 * 456 and its Unique ID field's ID is 2, then you would set up the group like so:
 *
 * $groups = array(
 *     array(
 *         123 => 1,
 *         456 => 2,
 *     )
 * );
