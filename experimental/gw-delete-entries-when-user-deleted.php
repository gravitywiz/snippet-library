 * Gravity Wiz // Gravity Forms // Delete User's Entries When User Deleted
 * https://gravitywiz.com/
 *
 * Automatically delete all of a user's entries across all forms when the user is deleted. If the user's content is
 * reassigned to another user, their entries will be reassigned to the same user rather than deleted.
 *
 * Note: This will only delete up to 300 entries due to performance concerns with this implementation. If you need to
 * delete more entries for a deleted user, [contact our support](https://gravitywiz.com/support/).
