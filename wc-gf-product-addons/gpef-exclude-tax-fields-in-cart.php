 * Gravity Perks // GP eCommerce Fields + Gravity Forms Product Add-ons for WooCommerce // Exclude Tax Fields
 *
 * Note: See https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/how-do-i-install-a-snippet/ for details on how to install snippets.
 *
 * Normally, GP eCommerce Fields Tax fields will be treated as Gravity Forms products when passed to WC Product Add-ons.
 * If WooCommerce is configured to handle taxes, passing the tax fields will result in double-taxation.
 *
 * This snippet prevents the tax fields/product from being added to WooCommerce cart.
 *
 * Use case: Display the tax on the product page to help show the customer a tax
 * estimate prior to getting to the cart.
