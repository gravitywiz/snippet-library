/**
 * Gravity Perks // File Upload Pro // Read Only
 * https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-file-upload-pro/
 *
 * Disable interactions on fields using File Upload Pro. This snippet hides the delete button, drop area,
 * upload button, drag handle, and crop button. This can be useful if the field is going to be hydrated from
 * another source such as GF User Registration and you are wanting to provide a way to display what's already
 * been uploaded.
 *
 * Instructions:
 *   1. Copy and paste these styles into your theme's style.css file (or anywhere your theme allows custom CSS).
 *   2. Enable File Upload Pro on your File Upload field.
 *   3. Add "gpfup-read-only" to the "Custom CSS Class" setting (on the Appearance tab).
