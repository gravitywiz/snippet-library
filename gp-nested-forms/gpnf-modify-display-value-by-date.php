/**
 * Gravity Perks // Nested Forms // Modify Display Value by Date
 * https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-nested-forms/
 *
 * Experimental Snippet ðŸ§ª
 *
 * This experimental snippet allows you to modify the display value of a Date field if the current date is greater than
 * the date saved in the given field.
 *
 * For example, if today was May 23, 2022 and the field's saved date was May 18, 2022, a "âœ”" would be displayed. For any
 * date on or after May 23, 2022, the saved date would be displayed.
