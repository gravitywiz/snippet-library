 *
 * Imagine a form with two Drop Down fields with available time slots. One Time Slot field is for a Standard package.
 * This field has inventory enabled and is scoped to a Date field and a Room field (a Drop Down field with available
 * rooms). If a Standard package is selected, a Room must also be selected.
 *
 * The other Time Slot field is for an Ultimate package. This field is configured identically to the Standard package;
 * however, Ultimate packages should claim inventory for both rooms for a given Date and Time Slot. When an Ultimate
 * package is selected, the Room field is hidden via conditional logic.
 *
 * The goal of this snippet is to ensure that the Ultimate field's claimed inventory applies to the Standard field's
 * inventory such that if the 2pm time slot is claimed for Room A (or Room B) in the Standard field, the 2pm time slot
 * in the Ultimate field is also claimed. Similarly, if the 2pm time slot is claimed in the Ultimate field, the 2pm time
 * slot should be claimed for both Room A and Room B in the Standard field (since the Ultimate package reserves both).
 *
 * This snippet achieves this by altering the query to remove the second scope (in this case, the Room field). The rules
 * for dictating when the Room scope is removed are explained in comments in the snippet below.
 *
 * Instructions:
 *
 * 1. Install the snippet.

 *
 * 2. Update the inline variables with your form and field IDs.
