 *
 * Populate a dynamic number of choices for a Quantity field based on a populated value. For example, a canoe might have
 * a capacity of 2 people while a pontoon may have a capacity of 8 people. If you populate the raw capacity as a choice
 * in the Quantity field, this snippet will then convert that single choice into a dynamic list of choices from 1 to the
 * specified capacity of the selected boat.
 *
 * Instructions
 *
 * 1. Install the snippet.
 *    https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/how-do-i-install-a-snippet/
 *
 * 2. Add the `gppa-dynamic-quantity-chocies` class to the desired field(s) "CSS Class Name" field setting.
