 *
 * Plugin Name:  GPPA Explode Commas into Choices
 * Plugin URI:   https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-populate-anything/
 * Description:  Convert comma-delimited values into choices when populated into a choice-based field.
 * Author:       Gravity Wiz
 * Version:      0.1
 * Author URI:   https://gravitywiz.com
 *
 * If you have an array-like value mapped to a choice-based field, Populate Anything does not yet know when it should be
 * converted to choices or imploded into a string so it defaults to the latter.
 *
 * This snippet adds the `gppa-explode-commas-into-choices` designator to allow you to specify when array-like values
 * should be converted into choices.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * 1. Install this code as a plugin or as a snippet.
 * 2. Add the `gppa-explode-commas-into-choices` designator to your field's CSS Class Name setting.
