 * Gravity Perks // Populate Anything // Add Multiple Custom Fields as Choices
 * https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-populate-anything/
 *
 * Use this snippet to dynamically populate a field with multiple custom field values.
 *
 * For example, imagine you have a booking represented by a WordPress Post object and that booking stores its deposit
 * price and full price as two separate custom fields. With this snippet, you would configure
 * your field to target the desired post and then add each option manually based on its post meta key.
