<!--
 * Gravity Perks // Entry Blocks // Hide Empty Columns on Edit
 * https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-entry-blocks/
 * 
 * If you include multiple Entry Blocks on the same page and click to view or edit a single entry,
 * only the block to which that entry belongs will be visible. If you have each Entry Block displayed
 * in its own column, this will render any other column empty in these views.
 *
 * Use this snippet to automatically find empty columns and remove them, making the remaining column
 * full width.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * 1. Add an HTML block to your page.
 * 2. Copy the snippet into that block.
