 * Gravity Perks // Easy Passthrough // Update Other Entry on Submission

 *
 * Update a field value of an entry on Form A when Form B is submitted based on populated
 * Easy Passthrough token.
 *
 * This technique provides a secure way to allow users to modify specific information on a previous
 * entry without exposing an entry ID. Exposing the entry ID can be a security risk as it is highly
 * predictable, potentially allowing bad actors to act on entries that do not belong to them.
 *
 * Note: this is very similar to our [GPEP Edit Entry](https://gravitywiz.com/edit-gravity-forms-entries-on-the-front-end/)
 * snippet. The key difference is the GPEP Edit Entry snippet is intended to update entries using the
 * same form that they were submitted from, while this snippet is intended to provide a more surgical
 * approach, updating only specific values on the original entry based on the submission of a separate form.
 *
 * Instructions
 *
 * 1. Add a Hidden field to Form B that will be used to capture an Easy Passthrough token.
 *
 * 2. Configure an Easy Passthrough feed on Form B to map data from Form A.
 *
 * 3. In the "Map Entry Meta" section, map the "Easy Passthrough Token" from Form A to the
 *    field you've created to capture it on Form B.
 *
 * 4. Install and configure this snippet per the inline instructions.
