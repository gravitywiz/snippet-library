/**
 * Gravity Perks // Conditional Logic Dates // Auto Rule Groups
 * https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-conditional-logic-dates/#relative-dates
 *
 * This snippet introduces the concept of automatic rule groups to Conditional Logic Dates. Auto rule groups are intelligently
 * modified time-based rules, adjusted based on the date-and-time-based rules that precede them.
 *
 * For example, if a rule is configured where the Current Time is greater than 5:00pm and second rule where the Current
 * Time is less than 8:00am, it is logical that the second rule is intended to check for 8:00am tomorrow. This snippet
 * set a base date modifier to increment the date used to calculate the time value for the next day.
 *
 * In the future, we look forward to adding support for enhancing this snippet with support for applying the same logic
 * when a Current Time rule is preceded by a Date field rule.
