 * Gravity Wiz // Gravity Forms // Delete Files After Notifications Sent
 * https://gravitywiz.com/
 *
 * This snippet will automatically delete all uploaded files after notifications have been sent. This pairs well with
 * Gravity Forms' "Attach uploaded fields to notification" notification option, allowing you to attach the files to a
 * notification without preserving the files on the file server.
 *
 * WARNING! Files will be deleted after submission regardless of whether notifications have been configured. Only
 * use this snippet if you have configuration your notifications to attach the files.
 *
 * Optionally, allow the submitter to decide if the files should be deleted or preserved by specifying a field ID and
 * corresponding field value that confirms files should be deleted. For example, a Drop Down may have two
 * choices: "Preserve Files" and "Delete Files". Specify "Delete Files" as the $delete_value below and files will only
 * be deleted if that choice is selected.
