/**
 * Gravity Wiz // Gravity Forms // Map Multiple Fields w/ Advanced Post Creation
 * https://gravitywiz.com/
 *
 * Experimental Snippet ЁЯзк
 *
 * By default, the Advanced Post Creation add-on does not allow you to map multiple fields to a taxonomy nor does it
 * allow you to set terms by ID.
 *
 * This snippet allows to specify multiple fields on a form that have been populated with term IDs (we recommend
 * [Populate Anything][1] for this) and to set the taxonomy/terms based on those IDs for the generated post.
 *
