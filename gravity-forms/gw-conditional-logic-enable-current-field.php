/**
 * Gravity Wiz // Gravity Forms // Enable Current Field in Conditional Logic
 * https://gravitywiz.com/
 *
 * By default, the current field being edited cannot contain a conditional logic rule based on itself. This makes sense
 * in most contexts except one really helpful scenario — when you want to hide a field if its empty!
 *
 * This snippet will allow you to create conditional logic rules based on the currently selected field in the form
 * editor. This works with any of Gravity Forms methods for dynamic population including our powerful Populate Anything
 * perk.
 *
 * Plugin Name:  Gravity Forms — Enable Current Field in Conditional Logic
 * Plugin URI:   https://gravitywiz.com/
 * Description:  Enable use of the current field when creating conditional logic rules in the form editor.
 * Author:       Gravity Wiz
